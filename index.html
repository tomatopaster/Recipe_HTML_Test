    <h1><strong>Yi Sang's Potato Skin Soup</strong></h1>
    <p>When I was in my youth my mother would often cook Potato Skin Soup. It was quite the hearty meal, 
        at least for what was to be had in my earlier years. Before S corp had changed heads, oft were there times of necessity. 
        I hope that this recipe finds you well, despite its humble origins.
    </p>
